		<h3> ME 573: Computational Fluid Dynamics </h3>
		<p>
			Provides an in-depth introduction to the methods and analysis techniques used in 
			computational solutions of fluid mechanics and heat transfer problems. Model problems 
			are used to study the interaction of physical processes and numerical techniques. 
			Contemporary methods for boundary layers, incompressible viscous flows, and inviscid 
			compressible flows are studied. Finite differences and finite volume techniques are emphasized
