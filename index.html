		<h1> Fall 2023 Course List</h1>
		<h2> 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics">ME 573: Computational Fluid Dynamics 
		</h2>
		<p> Provides an in-depth introduction to the methods and analysis techniques used in computational solutions of fluid mechanics and heat transfer problems. Model problems are used to study the interaction of physical processes and numerical techniques. Contemporary methods for boundary layers, incompressible viscous flows, and inviscid compressible flows are studied. Finite differences and finite volume techniquesare emphasized. </p>
		
		<h2> MATH 415: Applied Dynamical Systems, Chaos and Modeling </h2>
		<p> An introduction to nonlinear dynamical systems including stability, bifurcations and chaos. The course will give underlying mathematical ideas, but emphasize applications from many scientific fields. </p>

		<h2> COMP SCI 412: Introduction to Numerical Methods </h2>
		<p> Interpolation, solution of linear and nonlinear systems of equations, approximate integration and differentiation, numerical solution of ordinary differential equations, Data fitting (such as least squares) by polynomials and splines. </p>

		<h2> PHYSICS 241: Introduction to Modern Physics </h2>
		<p> Kinetic theory; relativity; experimental origin of quantum theory; atomic structure and spectral lines; topics in solid state, nuclear and particle physics. </p>
