				<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;"> Mathematics bridges the humanities and the sciences. Its position among the humanities is based on the study of mathematics as one of the liberal arts for more than two thousand years. The natural sciences have invariably turned to mathematics for techniques needed to explore the consequences of scientific theories. In the last few decades social scientists have increasingly found higher mathematics of value in their training and research.  Still an expanding subject, mathematics is a part of more new and challenging frontiers than at any time in its long history—with many new fields, from data science to quantum computing, requiring new techniques and inspiring ideas for exploration. </p>

				<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;"> Engineering mechanics is the study of forces and the resulting deformations, accelerations, motions, vibrations, and other responses they cause. It forms the foundation of aerospace, mechanical or civil engineering, and is fundamental to important parts of biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, materials science, and other engineering disciplines. </p>

				<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large;"> The Department of Physics has a long history of providing  students with a great educational experience. The department awarded its first Ph.D. in 1899. Since then, physics students have earned degrees in virtually every area of physics, and the department's faculty has played key roles in a myriad of important research efforts. Physics is the science of the properties of matter, radiation, and energy in all forms. As such, it is the most fundamental of the sciences. It provides the underlying framework for the other physical sciences and engineering and for understanding physical processes in biological and environmental sciences. </p>
